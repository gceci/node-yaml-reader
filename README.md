# node-yaml-reader

This is a very simple project about a node yaml reader.

## Project purpose
data.yaml file contains a yaml specification sample with some dummy data.
index.js contains all the logic needed to read, parse and produce json output starting from the given data.yaml

let's assume you want to describe some data catalogue metadata on your data.yaml and store them into a data catalogue.
first thing first, you have access your yaml specs and read it.
then you must parse data creating a data structure based on given yaml.

## How to run
Just focus on Terminal and type:
node index.js

## How to try yourself
You can try to change data.yaml and test the behaviour of this simple code-base
be sure to save project changes before re-run for testing purposes.
